# Voicotromics
Voicotromics provides the idea for the deployment of voice data for strengthening biometrics in fusion with the piezoelectric wearable printed sensor with a programmable acoustic neural network (PANN).

## Algorithms
#Programmable acoustic neural network (PANN)
It is a sequential model that consists of four layers one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer containing 128, 64, 32, and 1 neuron, respectively.

#Principal component analysis (PCA)
It is an unsupervised algorithm that can work well for separating the different features.

Voicotromics provides the idea for the deployment of voice data for strengthening biometrics in fusion with the piezoelectric wearable printed sensor with a programmable acoustic neural network (PANN).

## Algorithms
#Programmable acoustic neural network (PANN)
It is a sequential model that consists of four layers one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer containing 128, 64, 32, and 1 neuron, respectively.

#Principal component analysis (PCA)
It is an unsupervised algorithm that can work well for separating the different features. here, PCA has been utilized for recognizing the speakers based on their voiceprint features.

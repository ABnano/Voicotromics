Voicotromics provides the idea for the deployment of voice data for strengthening biometrics in fusion with the piezoelectric wearable printed sensor with a programmable acoustic neural network (PANN).

## Algorithms
##Programmable acoustic neural network (PANN):
It is a sequential model that consists of four layers one input layer, two hidden layers, and one output layer containing 128, 64, 32, and 1 neuron, respectively.

##Principal component analysis (PCA):
It is an unsupervised algorithm that can work well for separating the different features. here, PCA has been utilized for recognizing the speakers based on their voiceprint features.

# Voicotromics
Voicotromics provides the idea for deployment of the voice data for strengthening the biometrics in fusion with the piezoelectric wearable printed sensor with programmable acoustic neural networok (PANN).

## Algorithms
#Programmable acoustic neural netowrk (PANN)
It is a sequential model that consisits of four layers one input layer, two hidden layers and one output layer cpntaining 128, 64, 32 ans 1 neuron, respectively.

#Principal componenet analysis (PCA)
It is a unsupervised algorithm that can works well for seprating the different features.
